Buttinger became a socialist and at 24 served as the secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Austria. Imprisoned for several months in 1934 because of his political beliefs and anti-Nazi activities, he finally fled Austria for Paris when Germany annexed the country in 1938 and, in 1940, came to the United States. He helped form the International Rescue Committee, an organization dedicated to helping refugees fleeing from oppression. Only formally educated through sixth grade, Buttinger nonetheless became a scholar and analyst on Vietnam, writing several well-received books. He died in 1992. \n\nButtinger gave the last part of his utopia collection to the Graduate Center in 1971. There are a total of 1,204 titles in the collection, with the majority in English. However, there are large parts of the collection in French (247 titles) and in German (229 titles). The oldest book was published in 1631 and written by Sir Francis Bacon. Buttinger’s broad interpretation of “utopia” included not only works of fiction but also those dealing with the real world. Bob Brown’s autobiography and his practical manuscript based on his experience in founding a cooperative farm in Louisiana, are two titles while another is Robert Owen’s 1841 book on how to establish self-supporting colonies based on communism. There are books on slavery as well as rare serials. The most recent imprint is from 1972 and deals with forecasting future political and economic organizations.","thumbnail":"/view/delivery/thumbnail/01CUNY_GC/8173365810006140","library":{"value":"GC001","desc":"Mina Rees Library"},"sort_by":"title","external_system":"","external_id":"","order":4},{"pid":{"value":"8173266270006140","link":"https://api-na.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/almaws/v1/bibs/collections/8173266270006140"},"mms_id":{"value":"9994494376206140","link":"https://api-na.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/almaws/v1/bibs/9994494376206140"},"name":"Queer Biography","description":"A small but diverse selection of biographies on LGBTQA+ subjects, all available to borrow from the library’s circulating collection.
